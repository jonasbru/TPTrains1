0) High-level description

	We have placed sensors before each intersection of each side of the track. There are two types of track sections, critical sections and sections with two parallel rails (three of each in the given circuit).
	
	Each section is associated with a semaphore, and each semaphore is associated with sensors placed around the section. For critical sections, the semaphore can prevent two trains to be on the section at the same time. For the two-lane sections, the semaphore can determine which path to take to avoid two trains to be on the same track.
	
	In addition, we have placed sensors before each station so that trains know when to stop.
	
	When a train passes over a sensor, we look at which sensor it is, and so we retrieve the associated semaphore. According to the state of it, the train continues, stops or takes another rail if possible.
	
	In addition, we keep in memory the current section of the train, so that when the train passes over a sensor, we known if it enters or exits the section associated with the sensor.

1) Placement of the sensors

	All sensors are placed at the same distance from intersections so that we can determine the maximum speed of trains (trains have a stop distance linked to their speed). Trains must be able to stop before the intersection from the time they passed over the sensor. We set the minimal distance of 3 units (With this distance trains can't be either on an intersection and on a sensor).

	There are 4 sensors near stations which allow trains to know when to stop. Its detector also respect the minimum distance of 3 units before the end of the track.

2) Choice of critical sections

	We have identified three critical sections. Two sections protect areas where there is only one rail (bottom left and middle right). Its allow that there is no more than one train simultaneously on these areas.
	
	The last critical section protects the intersection (perpendicular) top left: there can be only one train around this intersection to avoid crashes.
	
3) Maximum train speed and the reason for it
	The maximum speed of the trains is 22. This is the maximum speed that allows trains to stop before 3 units of distance (minimum distance between an intersection and a detector).
	
4) How you tested your solution
	We placed a detector 3 units of an intersection and we have checked that the train has time to stop before the intersection.

	We tested the entire program by running the simulation (accelerated) with trains with very different speeds (5 and 20 for example) and we have verified that there are no problems
