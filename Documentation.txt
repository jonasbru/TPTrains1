0) What is the purpose of each method in the monitor?
 -enter(): Waits until the section protected by the monitor is free, and then ensures that nobody else enters the section until the "leave" method is called.
 -leave(): Signals when the section protected by the monitor is free.
 -tryEnter(): Checks if the section protected by the monitor is free. If the section is free, ensures that nobody else enters the section until the "leave" method is called and return true. Otherwise, if the section is not free, returns false.
